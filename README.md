# Network Discovery (Currently under development)

Run the network_discovery.py file which imports the scan.py file.

It will display all the available interfaces in your PC/Laptop.
Select the interface for which you want to scan the network.

It will take the network address and the subnet mask and iterate for the number of host available in the network.
The available devices will be displayed with the hostname and their IP address in that network.
